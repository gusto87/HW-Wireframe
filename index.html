                           <p> My name is William Sherrill. Originally from SC I moved to Charlotte NC 7 years ago. I was in construction 
                        upon moving here but, did not enjoy my work and wanted to do something I felt more meaningful.
                        I alway was intrigued by computers and have awlays been involved with them recreationally but now I want
                        to make this a lucrative, exciting, and worthwhile career. I am eager to learn this and grateful for this opportunity.</p>

                        <p>I am a certified full stack developer with a certificate from UNC Charlotte. It's a full stack bootcamp where we are learned the main technologies that are used 
                        for web applications in today's software. We have collaborated in projects to create resourceful  webpages and servers.
                        I really enjoyed the experience and will continue learning about new technologies  </p>
           
                        <p> I know that this is something I want to do and will feel a sense of accomplishment with a great career. I'm always trying to do what I can 
                            to become a more prominent developer. </p>
