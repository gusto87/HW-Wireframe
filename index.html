        <p class="text"> My name is William Sherrill. As a rookie to coding i find it challenging and exciting.
            I believe my attentiveness will help somewhat with this course, but like we were told grit goes a long way.
            I alway was intrigued by computers and have awlays been involved with them recreationally but now I want to make
            this a lucrative exciting and worthwhile career. I am eager to learn this but I have to manage my time better.
