       <p>
          This is my first attempt at coding, I find it exciting but also challenging. <br/>
        I changed my occupation from construction to tech but now im interested in software.<br/> 
        I really like learning and retaining knowlegde. I know this will <br/>
        really pay off in the end as i can design the ideas I have. </p>
        
                     <div id="h2">   <h2>Overcoming Obstacles</h2></div>
        <p>I want to design something cool and useful for users to enjoy.<br/>
        I have an app in mind and also possibly a game I would like to design.
        I'm having a bit of a troubling time with getting some of this stuff down.<br/>
        I get stumped at times and it takes me sometime to reiterate something we went
        over in class. By staying persisitent and using the resources<br/>
        available to me I believe I can conquer this.
        </p>
                      <div id="h3"> <h3>Relish in retaining</h3></div>
        <p>
            So by paying attention and trying to do as many of the assignments<br/>
        and seeking help in class this will become nature to me. Its hard to believe that
        the TAs were in the same boat as me. They are motivation for me to acheive my goal 
        and are great instructors to boot.
