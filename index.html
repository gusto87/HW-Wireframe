             <p class="text1"> My name is William Sherrill. As a rookie to coding i find it challenging and exciting.
                        I believe my attentiveness will help somewhat with this course, but like we were told grit goes a long
                        way.
                        I alway was intrigued by computers and have awlays been involved with them recreationally but now I want
                        to make
                        this a lucrative exciting and worthwhile career. I am eager to learn this but I have to manage my time
                        better.
                    </p>
                </section>
            <p class="text2">
                I am really digging this course in development.I still have some 
                concepts to really learn and take in. I want to make the most of this 
                course so i aim to apply myself as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="text3">
                I have to learn how to not overthink things and look at them
                not so critically sometimes. I know that this is something I want
                to do and will feel a sense of accomplishment with development. 
                will
