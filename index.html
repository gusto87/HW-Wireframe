                           <p> My name is William Sherrill a full stack developer focused on UI and front end development. Im and analytical thinker with excellent communication skills and strong determination.
                       
                        I always was intrigued by computers and have awlays been involved with them recreationally but now I want
                        to make this a lucrative, exciting, and worthwhile career. I am eager to learn this and grateful for this opportunity.</p>

                        <p>I obtained my certificate from UNC Charlotte. It was the full stack bootcamp where we are learned the main technologies that are used 
                        for web applications in today's software such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, bootstrap, Git, and more . We have collaborated in projects to create resourceful webpages and servers.
                        I really enjoyed the experience and will continue learning about new technologies  </p>
           
                        <p> I know that this is something I want to do and will feel a sense of accomplishment with a great career. I'm always trying to do what I can 
                            to become a more prominent developer. </p>
