                            My name is William Sherrill. Originally from SC I moved to Charlotte NC 7 years ago. I was in construction 
                        upon moving here but, did not enjoy my work and wanted to do something I felt more meaningful.
                        I alway was intrigued by computers and have awlays been involved with them recreationally but now I want
                        to make this a lucrative, exciting, and worthwhile career. I am eager to learn this and grateful for this opportunity.

                        I changed my career path to something I would feel passionate about. I relish in the thoughts of being able to create
                        applications or interfaces that people would be able to use and  benefit from. 
                        I want to make the most of this course so I aim to apply myself as much as possible. 
           
                        I have to learn how to not overthink things and look at them
                        not so critically sometimes. I know that this is something I want
                        to do and will feel a sense of accomplishment with development. I'm always open to 
                        constructive critisism and sound advice to become a prominent developer.
